   School, Career Interests, and Goals!
  </h2>
  <p>
   I am homeschooled and currently a senior in high school. I am dual enrolled at Rappahannock Community College and I am taking fifteen credit hours this semester. I have not decided what career I want to pursue yet, but some of my career interests include computer science, engineering, and accounting. One of my personal goals is to get an Associate Degree at community college and then transfer to a four-year college to get a Bachelorâ€™s Degree.
