  Something Told the Wild Geese by Rachel Field
  </h2>
  <p>
   Something told the wild geese <br>
   It was time to go. <br>
   Though the fields lay golden <br>
   Something whispered, "Snow."
  </p>
  <p>
   Leaves were green and stirring, <br>
   Berries luster-glossed, <br>
   But beneath warm feathers, <br>
   Something cautioned, "Frost."
  </p>
  <p>
   All the sagging orchards <br>
   Steamed with amber spice, <br>
   But each wild breast stiffened <br>
   At remembered ice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Something told the wild geese <br>
   It was time to fly... <br>
   Summer sun was on their wings, <br>
   Winter in their cry.
